## Overview

This project uses a pre-trained **MobileNetV2** that is fine-tuned on the provided image dataset. Key features include:

- **Data Augmentation**: Applies random flips, rotations, zooming, and contrast adjustments to reduce overfitting.
- **Data Visualizations**: Explores color channel distribution, brightness, and contrast between the classes.
- **Model Retraining System**: A script that tracks when the model needs retraining based on accuracy drops, new dataset uploads, or elapsed time.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Local Python Setup

Clone the code and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd downsyndrome
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Docker Setup

To start the API and the UI dashboard simultaneously, use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This starts the backend (from `Dockerfile`) and the frontend (from `ui.Dockerfile`).

## Usage

### 1. Exploration & Training

Start the Jupyter Notebook to rerun the ML pipeline from scratch, view data distribution, train the model, and track performance.

```bash
jupyter notebook notebook/down_syndrome.ipynb
```

The notebook automatically saves the trained models to the `models/` directory so the API can use them.

### 2. Scripts (`src/`)

Use the python modules to run predictions locally:

- `src/preprocessing.py`: Import functions here to process images so they match the `224x224` shape required by MobileNetV2.
- `src/prediction.py`: Use this to load the `.keras` model and score new images.

### 3. API Inference

If testing the API standalone:

```bash
python api/app.py
```

Once running, it accepts image uploads and returns a JSON response containing the confidence scores and class predictions.

## Automated Retraining

The notebook includes a `RetrainingTrigger` class. It flags when the model should be retrained if:

1. Training accuracy drops below a specific threshold (e.g., 80%).
2. Enough new training samples (e.g., 50 new photos) have been uploaded to the system.
3. A set amount of time (e.g., 7 days) has passed since the last training run.
